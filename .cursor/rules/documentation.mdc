# Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)

## Project Context Documentation
- Map implementation uses OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js, not Google Maps or Mapbox as might be assumed
- Project consists of two separate repositories (frontend and backend) with no shared code
- Frontend is deployed to Google Cloud Storage (static hosting), not a traditional web server
- Backend is deployed to Google Cloud Run (containerized), not a traditional server

## Technical Implementation Details
- Local tile caching is a critical requirement for map performance and offline viewing
- Branching strategy follows GitFlow with specific naming conventions (feature/, release/, hotfix/)
- No authentication is implemented in the MVP (all endpoints are public)
- Health check endpoint is at `/health` path specifically

## Deployment and Infrastructure
- Google Cloud Storage requires specific configuration for static file serving
- Google Cloud Run requires proper containerization and environment configuration
- CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions for both repositories
- Separate deployment processes for frontend (static) and backend (containerized)

## Cursor-Specific Documentation Guidelines
- When explaining concepts, clarify the two-repository architecture
- Always mention the Google Cloud deployment strategy
- Explain the offline-first approach for map viewing
- Document the local tile caching implementation requirements
- Clarify that this is an MVP with no authentication
- Mention the specific technology choices (Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap) and why they were selected
- Explain the separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- Document the manual testing requirements for map functionality
