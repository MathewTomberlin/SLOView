# SLO View - Final Architecture Summary

## Project Overview

The SLO View application is a web-based mapping application that displays a map of San Luis Obispo county with drag and zoom functionality. The application consists of:

1. **React Frontend** - Hosted in Google Cloud Storage
2. **Spring Boot Backend** - Hosted in Google Cloud Run

## Architecture Decisions

### Map Implementation
- **Selected Approach**: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet.js
- **Rationale**: 
  - Completely free and open-source solution
  - No ongoing API costs
  - Good performance with local tile caching
  - Supports offline viewing of previously loaded areas
  - Well-documented and widely supported

### Repository Structure
- **Separate Repositories**:
  - `slo-view-frontend` - React frontend application
  - `slo-view-backend` - Spring Boot API backend

### Deployment Strategy
- **Frontend**: Google Cloud Storage static hosting
- **Backend**: Google Cloud Run containerized deployment
- **Networking**: Egress between Google Cloud services is free

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js v17+
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap data
- **Components**:
  - Navigation bar with "SLO View" title
  - Interactive map viewer with drag and zoom
- **Dependencies**:
  - react: ^17.0.2
  - react-dom: ^17.0.2
  - leaflet: ^1.7.1
  - react-leaflet: ^3.2.0

### Backend
- **Framework**: Spring Boot 2.5+
- **Language**: Java 11+
- **Functionality**: Minimal health check endpoint at `/health`
- **Dependencies**:
  - spring-boot-starter-web
  - spring-boot-starter-actuator (optional)

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for ongoing development
- Feature branches for new functionality

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Separate workflows for frontend and backend
- Automated deployment to Google Cloud services

## Cost Considerations

### Free Tier Utilization
- Google Cloud Storage: Static hosting within free tier limits
- Google Cloud Run: Runtime within free tier limits
- OpenStreetMap: Completely free with no usage limits
- No ongoing API costs for map data

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Development**:
   - Set up React project structure
   - Implement navigation bar component
   - Integrate Leaflet.js for map rendering
   - Implement drag and zoom functionality
   - Style components for responsive design

2. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up Spring Boot project
   - Implement health check endpoint
   - Configure for Google Cloud Run deployment
   - Add monitoring and logging

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for both frontend and backend
   - Integration testing
   - Manual UI testing for map functionality

4. **Deployment**:
   - Set up Google Cloud infrastructure
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines
   - Deploy to production environments
   - Verify functionality
