# Map Implementation Options for SLO View

This document outlines various options for implementing the San Luis Obispo county map viewer, considering the requirements for local data storage, drag functionality, and zoom capabilities.

## Option 1: Local Map Data with Leaflet

### Description
Use locally stored map data (GeoJSON or TopoJSON) with the Leaflet.js library for rendering and interaction.

### Pros
- No API calls required for map rendering
- Complete control over map data
- Works offline once loaded
- Free and open-source
- Lightweight library
- Good performance for local data

### Cons
- Requires obtaining and maintaining map data
- Larger initial download size
- Less detailed than commercial map services
- No real-time traffic or satellite imagery

### Implementation Details
- Use Leaflet.js for map rendering
- Store SLO county boundary data as GeoJSON
- Implement drag and zoom with Leaflet's built-in handlers
- Add custom styling for the map

### File Size Considerations
- SLO county boundary GeoJSON: ~100KB - 500KB
- Leaflet.js library: ~40KB

### Free Tier Compatibility
- 100% free (no API calls)
- No ongoing costs

## Option 2: Google Maps API with Free Tier

### Description
Use Google Maps JavaScript API with locally cached or bundled map tiles where possible.

### Pros
- Highly detailed maps
- Satellite and terrain views
- Well-documented API
- Built-in drag and zoom functionality
- Google's free tier allows 28,000 map loads per month

### Cons
- Requires API key management
- Potential costs if exceeding free tier
- Dependent on Google's services
- Requires internet connection

### Implementation Details
- Use Google Maps JavaScript API
- Implement custom styling for SLO county focus
- Use map bounds to restrict view to SLO county area
- Implement drag and zoom with Google Maps built-in handlers

### Free Tier Details
- 28,000 map loads per month
- 5,000 geolocation requests per month
- No cost for usage under these limits

### Cost Considerations
- Free for low-traffic applications
- $7 per 1,000 additional map loads if exceeded

## Option 3: Mapbox with Free Tier

### Description
Use Mapbox GL JS with locally styled map focusing on SLO county.

### Pros
- Highly customizable maps
- Good free tier (50,000 map views per month)
- Vector tiles for better performance
- Good documentation
- Built-in drag and zoom functionality

### Cons
- Requires API key management
- Dependent on Mapbox services
- Requires internet connection

### Implementation Details
- Use Mapbox GL JS library
- Create custom style focusing on SLO county
- Implement drag and zoom with Mapbox built-in handlers

### Free Tier Details
- 50,000 map views per month
- 100,000 map sessions per month

### Cost Considerations
- Free for most small applications
- $0.50 per 1,000 map views if exceeded

## Option 4: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet

### Description
Use OpenStreetMap data rendered with Leaflet.js, potentially caching tiles locally.

### Pros
- Completely free and open-source
- No API key required
- Good community support
- Can cache tiles locally for offline use
- Built-in drag and zoom functionality

### Cons
- Requires implementing tile caching for offline use
- Less polished than commercial alternatives
- Dependent on OSM data quality

### Implementation Details
- Use Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap tile layer
- Implement tile caching with localStorage or IndexedDB
- Custom styling to highlight SLO county

### Free Tier Compatibility
- 100% free (no API calls or usage limits)
- No ongoing costs

## Recommendation

Based on the requirements for minimizing API calls and staying within free tier usage, I recommend **Option 1: Local Map Data with Leaflet** for the following reasons:

1. **No ongoing costs** - Once implemented, there are no API fees
2. **Complete offline functionality** - No internet required for map viewing
3. **Full control** - Complete control over map data and styling
4. **Performance** - Fast loading and interaction with local data
5. **Simplicity** - No API key management required

### Implementation Approach

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Obtain SLO county boundary data from US Census Bureau or similar source
   - Convert to GeoJSON format if needed
   - Optimize file size through simplification if necessary

2. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Integrate Leaflet.js library
   - Load local GeoJSON data
   - Implement custom styling for SLO county
   - Add drag and zoom functionality
   - Ensure responsive design

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize GeoJSON file size
   - Implement lazy loading if needed
   - Add loading indicators for better UX

### Alternative Recommendation

If more detailed maps or satellite imagery is required, **Option 4: OpenStreetMap with Leaflet** would be the next best choice as it:
- Remains completely free
- Provides more detailed maps than basic GeoJSON
- Still allows for local tile caching
- Has a good balance of features and cost

## Next Steps

1. Confirm which approach to take
2. Obtain appropriate map data (if using local data approach)
3. Implement proof of concept
4. Test performance and user experience
5. Optimize based on feedback
